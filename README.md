# HVRPSPD - MILP-based VLSN

This is the implementation of the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based Very Large-Scale Neighborhood search (VLSN) specialized to the
Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (HVRPSPD).

We also recommend referring to the Github version of the code used, as future versions may achieve better performance as the code evolves. The
version associated with the results presented in [2] is v1.0.0, and IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.8 was employed as the underlying solver of MILP models.
